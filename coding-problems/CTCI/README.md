# 1.4 - Palindrome Permutations
Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome. 

Example:
```
Input:  Tact coa
Output: True ("taco cat", "atco cta", ...etc...)
```

# 1.6 - String Compression
(NOTE - Work in progress)

Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. 

Example:
```
aabcccccaaa => a2b1c5a3
```

If the compressed string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return the original string. You can assume the string only has uppercase and lowercase letters (a-z).
